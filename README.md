The task is to develop a web application that allows users to create accounts, log in, and access their personal profiles. The project begins with the development of a login page, which includes fields for the user's email address, password, Date of Birth and other credentials. The user's email and password are then validated against records database. If the user's credentials are correct, the application logs the user into the system and stores their session information in Redis for future reference.

Once logged in, users can access their personal profile pages, which are stored in the database. The personal profile page includes information such as the user's name, email address, age, Contact number and other details they may choose to provide.

Users can update their profiles and view the profiles of other users.

Local Storage is done instaed of session storage. The user can store and access data without expiration; the data will be available even after a visitor closes the site.

Overall, the MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, PHP Login Page Project is an excellent example of how different technologies can be used together to create a reliable web application. By leveraging the strengths of each technology, the application is able to provide a secure and efficient platform for users to create and manage their accounts, log in, and access their personal profiles.
